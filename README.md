# First Part: Introduction
El objetivo de esta guia es de proporcionar la informacion teorica y practica necesaria acerca del funcionamiento de las Funciones Azure con Docker para que quien lo lea tenga la posibilidad de aprender lo basico y luego si lo desea poder profundizar en conocimientos mas avanzados.

## What is [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-azure/)?
Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed data centers. It provides software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and supports many different programming languages, tools and frameworks, including both Microsoft-specific and third-party software and systems.

## What is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)?
Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises. Docker is also a company that promotes and evolves this technology. Docker works in collaboration with cloud, Linux, and Windows vendors, including Microsoft.

## Docker Vs Virtual Machine
The big difference is that a virtual machine needs to contain the entire operating system while a Docker container takes advantage of the operating system on which it runs, shares the kernel of the host operating system and even part of its libraries

# Pros of a Docker Container
* You can put anything in there
* Stays locked
* Efficient transport
* No missing dependencies during deployments
* You can run various versions of libraries
* Reduce compatibily concerns
* Self contained - everything you need is in â€¦
* an isolated environment
* and therefore highly portable
* it runs everywhere - also in the cloud
* it is (relatively) small and lightweight
* therefore very scalable
* and thus cost-efficient.
